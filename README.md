# How to update the [bemio](http://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/) website 

## Download and install required packages
1. Download and Install [Python27](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1. Add Python and Python Scripts to system path
  * [Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7) - modify the PATH in environmental variables to include: C:\PYTHON27;C:\PYTHON27\Scripts 
  * MAC/LINUX -  Python is already installed on MAC/LINUX and added to path

1. Download and Install [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html)
  * [Windows](http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html#windows-install-python-and-sphinx) - Install on command prompt using ``pip install -U Sphinx``
  * [MAC/LINUX](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/install.html#mac-os-x-install-sphinx-using-macports) - Install on command prompt using ``pip install -U Sphinx``

 **NOTE:** You may need to configure PROXY

1. Install BibTeX extension for Sphinx
  * Install on command prompt using ``pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex``
  * Install the rtd theme using ``pip install sphinx_rtd_theme``. 
 
 **NOTE:** You may have to manually move it to the ``sphinx/themes/`` directory.

## Modify the [bemio](http://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/) website
The bemio documentation is located on the bemio/gh-pages branch, https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio/tree/gh-pages, which will be referred to as the ``$USERS_GUIDE``.

The users guide is developed using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) and rendered in html. To edit  the users guide, modify the source files located in the ``$USERS_GUIDE/source`` folder using syntax and methods described in the [Sphinx Documentation](http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html). Once you are done editing, move to the ``$USERS_GUIDE`` folder type ``make html`` from the command line to build the documentation. This builds a html formatted copy of the documentation in the ``$USERS_GUIDE/`` folder. After building the HTML users guide, you can view the local copy of the documentation by opening the ``$USERS_GUIDE/index.html`` file in a web browser

## Push Documentation to the [bemio](http://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/) website
The github.io website renders the documentation in the bemio/gh-pages branch as a website located at http://wec-sim.github.io/bemio/index.html. The user then pushes changes in the html documentation directly to the bemio/gh-pages branch. Here are the steps to do this:

  ```Shell
  # Move to the build directory in cmd
  cd $USERS_GUIDE

  # Build the html documentation in cmd
  make html

  # Use Git-shell to check status of the gh-pages branch, then commit and push changes. 
  git status
  git add -A
  git commit -m 'update to bemio documentation'
  git push
  ```
