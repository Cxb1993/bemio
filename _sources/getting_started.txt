Downloading
=================
The code is distributed through the `bemio GitHub webpage <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio>`_. There are three ways to obtain the code:

	* Archive download: The easiest way to obtain a copy of `bemio` is to download archive `bemio-1.0a0 archive <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio/releases/tag/v1.0a0>`_.

	* Clone with Git: `bemio` can also be obtained by cloning the repository with Git::

		git clone https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio.git

	* Fork with Git: If you are planning to contribute to the `bemio` code base, please follow the `forking instructions provided by GitHub <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_. If you implement an improvement you would like included in the `bemio` code base please make a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_ so that your improvement can be merged into the code base.

.. _installing:

Installing
==========
`bemio` is written in Python 2.7 and is compatible with OSX, Windows, and Linus operating systems. This section provides instructions on how to install `bemio` and test that you installation is working correctly. Simple instillation instructions are provided for users who simply want to run `bemio` and developer Instillation Instructions are provided for users who would like to develop and contribute to the `bemio` code base.

`Python 2.7.x <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ must be installed on your system to use `bemio`. In addition, the following python packages must be installed on your system:

* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy
* progressbar2
* astropy
* h5py

Although not required, `bemio` users will benefit from installing `HDFVIEW <http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>'_. HDF5VIEW allows `bemio` users to view and interact with the standardized bemio hydrdynamic data files.

Simple Instillation Instructions - Windows
------------------------------------------

Step 1: Install Python
	Download and install the `Anaconda Python 2.7 distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. Anaconda comes packaged with the required python modules, with the exception of the `progressbar2` python package. This package will is installed with the `bemio` distribution. When Anaconda Python is successfully installed, you will be able to launch Python from a `Windows Command Prompt <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window>`_. Test that python was correctly by opening a command prompt and try launching Python.

Step 2: Download `bemio`
	Download the `bemio-1.0a0-archive <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio/releases/tag/v1.0a0>`_.

Step 3: Extract the bemio `bemio` from the archive
	Extract `bemio` from the archive and move the source code folder to the desired location. This folder will be referred to as $BEMIO_SOURCE from here on.

Step 4: Install `bemio`
	Open a Windows Command Prompt and navigate to the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder. Once inside the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder execute the following command from the Command Prompt::

		python setup.py install

	This installs the `bemio` files to your `$PYTHONPATH <https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables>`_ allowing you to run the code. Note that if you do not have administrative privileges on your system you will need to run the ``setup.py`` script from a `Command Prompt with administrative rights <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813%28v=ws.10%29.aspx>`_.

Step 5: Test the instillation
	Test the `bemio` by moving running the command inside the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder::

		python bemio_test.py

	The WAMIT, AQWA, and NEMOH test cases should run successfully and you should get a success messages for each test case.

Step 1: Install Python
	Download and install the `Anaconda Python 2.7 distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. Anaconda comes packaged with the required python modules, with the exception of the `progressbar2` python package. This package will is installed with the `bemio` distribution. When Anaconda Python is successfully installed, you will be able to launch Python from a terminal command prompt. Test that python was correctly by opening a terminal and try launching Python.

Step 2: Download `bemio`
	Download the `bemio-1.0a0-archive <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/bemio/releases/tag/v1.0a0>`_.

Step 3: Extract the bemio `bemio` from the archive
	Extract `bemio` from the archive and move the source code folder to the desired location. This folder will be referred to as $BEMIO_SOURCE from here on. 

Step 4: Install `bemio`
	Open terminal window and navigate to the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder. Once inside the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder execute the following command from the Command Prompt::

		sudo python setup.py install

	This installs the `bemio` files to your `$PYTHONPATH <https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables>`_ allowing you to run the code.

Step 5: Test the instillation
	Test the `bemio` by moving running the command inside the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder::

		python bemio_test.py

	The WAMIT, AQWA, and NEMOH test cases should run successfully and you should get a success messages for each test case.
	

.. _developer_install:

Developer Instillation Instructions
-----------------------------------

These instructions assume the user has a advanced level of Python knowledge. These instillation instructions should also be followed for users who do not have administrative rights on their system.

Step 1: Install Python
	Install Python 2.7.x and the Python modules identified in the `Installing`_ section.

Step 2: Download `bemio`
	Download, clone, or fork `bemio` as described in the `Downloading`_ section. The top level of the `bemio` source code will be referred to as $BEMIO_SOURCE

Step 3: Install `bemio`
	Add the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder to your `PYTHONPATH <https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables>`_ environment variable.

Step 4: Test the instillation
	Run the ``bemio_test.py`` script inside the $BEMIO_SOURCE folder::

		python bemio_test.py

	The WAMIT, AQWA, and NEMOH test cases should run successfully and you should get a success messages for each test case.
