Tutorials
=========
This section provides tutorials that show how to use :ref:`API` to read, process, and save NEMOH, WAMIT, and AQWA simulation data. Specifically, the tutorials show how to:

	#. Create custom programs that read BEM simulation data
	#. Calculate impulse response functions
	#. Calculate state space coefficients from the impulse response functions
	#. Plot the data for visualization
	#. Save the data to the SHDF

`bemio` was developed so that users interact with the API in the same way regardless of the type of BEM data that is being read and processed. As such, we will present a thorough description of how to process WAMIT data in the 'WAMIT'_ tutorial, and abbreviated versions of the NEMOH and AQWA tutorials.

Tutorial Data Files
-------------------
Tutorial files are distributed with the `bemio` code and can be found in the ``$BEMIO_SOURCE/tutorials`` folder. This location will be refereed to as ``$BEMIO_TUTORIALS``.

WAMIT
-----
WAMIT tutorial files can be found in the ``$BEMIO_TUTORIALS/wamit`` folder. As shown below, the folder contains a ``data`` folder and a ``run.py`` folder as shown below.

The data folder contains several example WAMIT output files. In this tutorial we will use the ``wec3.out`` example data. This file contains WAMIT simulation from a floating three-body oscillating flap device shown below. This device geometry was used in the Wave Energy Converter Code Comparison (WEC3) project [1] and described by Babarit et al. [2] (FIX CITATIONs).

The ``run.py`` file contains a custom written script that uses the `bemio` :ref:`API` to read the ``wec3.out`` file, plot hydrodynamic coefficients, and save the data in the SHDF.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tutorials/wamit/run.py

Running the script above produces the following output:

Viewing the SHDF File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SHDF file containing the WAMIT data was written to ``$BEMIO_TUTORIALS/wamit/data/wec3.h5`` and can be viewed using `HDFVIEW <http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_ as shown below. `HDFVIEW <http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_ allows the different data to be viewed and simple line plots to be made. For example, the image below shows the added mass matrix (``wamit_data_obj.data[0].am.all``) with a shape of 6 x 6*num_bodies x num_frequencies, the body name from the WAMTI file (``wamit_data_obj.data[0].name``), the body center of gravity from the WAMIT file (``wamit_data_obj.data[0].cg``). Also shown is the 1,1 (surge) component of the added mass matrix, which is stored in the SHDF file in the ``bodyN/added_mass/comps/comp_1_1`` file. `HDFVIEW <http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_ was used to plot this added mass component.
